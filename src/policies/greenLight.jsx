      <p>
        The game processes audio signals and touch inputs <strong>entirely on your device</strong>.
        Audio files (green/red light sounds) are played locally, and touch interactions
        are processed in real-time for gameplay mechanics only.

      <h2>Game Engine Logic</h2>
      <p>
        The adaptive difficulty system (LIC Algorithm) and progress tracking
        operate entirely on your device. These algorithms analyze your gameplay
        patterns to adjust challenge levels, but this analysis happens locally
        and is not shared externally.
