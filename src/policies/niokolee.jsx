      <h1>Niokolee – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <p>
        Niokolee is an offline-first peer-to-peer debt and lending tracker
        designed for everyday life — loans, borrowed gadgets, small favors,
        and shared expenses. We take your privacy seriously, and this policy
        explains how your data is handled.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

        <li>Contacts, messages, or call logs</li>
        <li>Financial accounts, bank details, or payment history</li>
        <li>Browsing history or online activity</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers or analytics tracking</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>On-Device Processing Only</h2>
      <p>
        All debt tracking, QR contract handling, and credibility score calculations
        happen <strong>locally on your device</strong>. No personal or debt data is
        sent to any server.
      </p>

      <h2>Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Niokolee stores limited information locally, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Debts you owe and debts owed to you</li>
        <li>QR contract history for offline confirmations</li>
        <li>Credibility scores and related gamification state</li>
        <li>Notification history and read status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling
        the app.
      </p>

      <h2>Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        Niokolee uses local notifications to remind you of pending debts,
        repayments, or overdue penalties. These notifications are generated
        entirely on-device without any server involvement.
      </p>

      <h2>No Ads or Trackers</h2>
      <p>
        Niokolee contains <strong>no advertisements</strong>, 
        <strong>no analytics trackers</strong>, and 
        <strong>no third-party advertising SDKs</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>No Accounts Required</h2>
      <p>
        Niokolee works immediately after installation and does not require
        account creation or sign-in.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Niokolee does not collect personal information from anyone, including
        children. It complies with child privacy requirements by design.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be included
        with app updates. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of
        the updated policy.
