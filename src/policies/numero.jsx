        Numero is a simple trivia and quick-math game built for all ages. 
        We respect your privacy, and this policy explains how we handle your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Numero does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information. 
        Specifically, the app does not collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Names, emails, or contact details</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage data or analytics</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>No Internet Connection Required</h2>
      <p>
        Numero works entirely offline. The app does not send or receive any data 
        from external servers or third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>No Ads or Trackers</h2>
      <p>
        Numero contains <strong>no advertisements</strong>, 
        <strong>no tracking technologies</strong>, and 
        <strong>no third-party SDKs</strong> that collect information.
      </p>

      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>
        The app includes multiple language options (including English, Spanish, 
        German, French, Arabic, and others). These are built-in and do not require 
        online services or user data.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Numero is safe for children. Because the app does not collect any data, 
        it fully complies with child-focused privacy expectations.
      </p>
