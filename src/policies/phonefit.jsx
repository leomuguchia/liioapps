      <h1>PhoneFit – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <p>
        PhoneFit is a device insight app that helps you understand what your phone
        can do in real-world terms. We take your privacy seriously, and this policy
        explains how your data is handled.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        PhoneFit does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share personal data.
        The app does not collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses, or account information</li>
        <li>Precise or background location data</li>
        <li>Contacts, messages, or call logs</li>

        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Analytics or tracking data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>On-Device Processing Only</h2>
      <p>
        All PhoneFit analysis happens <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
        Device capabilities such as performance, battery status, storage,
        and sensors are evaluated in real time without sending data to any server.
      </p>

      <h2>Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        PhoneFit stores limited information locally on your device, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Previously shown insights or moments</li>
        <li>Notification history and read status</li>
        <li>Temporary device state used to avoid duplicate notifications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling
        the app.
      </p>

      <h2>Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        PhoneFit uses local notifications to alert you about relevant device
        conditions (such as low battery or storage). These notifications are
        generated entirely on-device and are not triggered by any server.
      </p>

      <h2>No Ads or Trackers</h2>
      <p>
        PhoneFit contains <strong>no advertisements</strong>, 
        <strong>no analytics trackers</strong>, and 
        <strong>no third-party advertising SDKs</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>No Accounts Required</h2>
      <p>
        PhoneFit does not require you to create an account or sign in.
        The app works immediately after installation.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        PhoneFit does not collect personal information from anyone, including
        children. As a result, it complies with child privacy requirements by
        design.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be included
        with app updates. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the
        updated policy.
      </p>
